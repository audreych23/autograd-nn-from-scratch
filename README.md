# HW2 - NN From Scratch Implementation with Autograd

current known bug: 
- 
if there's only one data in cce loss, it will break

next todo:
- 

- update parameters

- test out with the input data

- report

has been done:
- 

- make analytical gradient test
- input softmax and CCE 
- test out with MSE 
- finish base code  
- test out if loss reduces
